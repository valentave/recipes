    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>1 pinch of salt</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons of whole wheat flour</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons of all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>250ml of milk</li>
        <li>vanilla extract</li>
        <li>80g of melted butter</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon of baking powder</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons of sugar (optional for sweet pancakes)</li>
        <li>To serve: syrup, honey, nuts, fresh fruit, chocolate, peanut butter, dulce de leche.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place one egg in a bowl with a pinch of salt and beat.</li>
        <li>Add the whole wheat flour and all-purpose flour and mix well until combined. Add a 
            splash of milk to make it easier to beat.</li>
        <li>Add vanilla extract and sugar if you want them sweet. Add baking powder and beat 
            vigorously. Add melted butter.</li>
        <li>The mixture will be quite liquid. Chill in the fridge for half an hour, this step is 
            important so that the flour absorbs the liquid and thickens the mixture.</li>
        <li>In a non-stick frying pan with a little butter or cooking spray, place about two 
            tablespoons of the mixture. Cook until golden brown on both sides and serve.</li>
