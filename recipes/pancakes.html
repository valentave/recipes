        <li class="recipe-item">Place one egg in a bowl with a pinch of salt and beat.</li>
        <li class="recipe-item">Add the whole wheat flour and all-purpose flour and mix well until combined. Add a 
            splash of milk to make it easier to beat.</li>
        <li class="recipe-item">Add vanilla extract and sugar if you want them sweet. Add baking powder and beat 
            vigorously. Add melted butter.</li>
        <li class="recipe-item">The mixture will be quite liquid. Chill in the fridge for half an hour, this step is 
            important so that the flour absorbs the liquid and thickens the mixture.</li>

            tablespoons of the mixture. Cook until golden brown on both sides and serve.</li>
