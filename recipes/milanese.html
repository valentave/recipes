    <h1>Milanese</h1>
    <img src="../images/milanese.jpg">
    <p>The 'milanese' is a steak,typically made from beef, that is cooked by frying or baking.
        By extension, any slice of an ingredient that is breaded and cooked in a similar way is
        also called a 'milanese'.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon of mustard</li>
        <li>Juice and zest of 1 lemon</li>
        <li>1 garlic clove</li>
        <li>Chopped parsley</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon of grated cheese</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>The first thing we're going to do is beat the eggs and add all the marinade
            ingredients inside. We're going to mix everything well.</li>
        <li>We're going to season the Milanese steaks with salt and place them inside the
            marinade, they have to be well soaked. We're going to cover them with plastic wrap
            and put them in the refrigerator for at least one hour. The longer, the better.</li>
        <li>After that time, we're going to take them out of the refrigerator. Then, one
            Milanese at a time, we're going to coat them with breadcrumbs, pressing on both
            sides until they're well covered.</li>
        <li>Finally, all that's left is to fry them in hot oil until they're golden brown and
            enjoy them very much.</li>
    </ol>
